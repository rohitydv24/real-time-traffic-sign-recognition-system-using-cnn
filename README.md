Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN
This GitHub repository contains an implementation of a real-time traffic sign recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project offers two input methods:

**Upload Sign Image:** The software provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to upload an image of a traffic sign for recognition. The CNN model will process the uploaded image and predict the corresponding traffic sign based on the learned patterns.

**Camera Access:** The system also supports real-time traffic sign recognition using a connected camera. By leveraging the OpenCV library, the program accesses the camera feed and continuously analyzes the video stream to identify traffic signs. The recognized signs are then displayed on the screen in real-time.      
**Key Features**        
**CNN Model:** The repository includes a pre-trained CNN model specifically designed for traffic sign recognition. The model has been trained on a large dataset of annotated traffic sign images to achieve high accuracy in recognizing various signs.      

**Upload and Recognition:** Users can easily upload an image of a traffic sign through the GUI-based software. The CNN model processes the image and provides the predicted label of the recognized sign.      

**Real-Time Camera Access:** By utilizing the OpenCV library, the system allows users to access a connected camera and perform real-time traffic sign recognition. The recognized signs are displayed directly on the camera feed.      

**GUI-based Software:**  The software provides a user-friendly GUI developed using Tkinter, making it simple and intuitive to interact with the system. Users can upload images, view recognized signs, and switch to camera mode easily.
